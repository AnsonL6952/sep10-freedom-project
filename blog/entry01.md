### Why I chose Medical Industry?
I chose the Medical Industry because there are alot of things to learn about overall on human body and health. It can teach people about organ function, diseases, and medical conditions. These sources can help us learn how it functions and why it happens to us. In my personal experience, I often find joy in helping people and giving people advice that can help them in the long run with their life, or save them from certain situations that they're not knowledgable about. I find giving people medical advice helpful and the best way of benefiting them. Another personal experience that made me take interest in the medical industry was that I once went into a hospital due to medical circumstances and I saw how committed the doctors were to saving others and helping them live a better life overall. They made sure there weren't any safety concerns in the body and comforted patients when they were in serious situations that causes them to go through emotional breakdown. This is why I would like to one day prioritize it as my career or as my passion because I want to help people and help them get through serious situations that they have to try and endure. I also want to see how far I can go as I pursue medical industry and whether or not it is fit for me, For now it is my #1 option. In case it doesn't work out or I don't feel like it's the right career for me, I might pursue in biology and engineering as I feel like they are the 2nd and 3rd best option because I really like creating tools made from my hands and do dirty work.
## Links 
Some links I clicked on which helped me discover more about the Medical Industry was  [Medical careers A-Z](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/explore-health-care-careers/careers-a-z/).

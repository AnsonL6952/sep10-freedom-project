### Why I chose Medical Industry?
I chose the Medical Industry because there are alot of things to learn about overall on human body and health. It can teach people about organ function, diseases, and medical conditions. These sources can help us learn how it functions and why it happens to us. In my person experience I often find joy helping people and giving people advice that can help them in the long run with their life or safe them from certain situations that they're not knowledgable about, I find helping give people medical advice the best way of helping people. Another personal experience that made me take intrest about the Medical Industry was that I once went into a hospital due to medical circumstances and I saw how commited doctors were to saving others or helping them live a better life overall they made sure there weren't any safety concerns in the body and comforted patients when they were in serious situations that causes them to go through emotional breakdown. This is why I would like to one day prioritize it as my career or as my passion because I want to help people and help them get through serious situations that they have to try and endure. I also want to see how far I can go as I pursue Medical Industry and whether or not it is fit for me, For now it is my #1 option. 

## Links 
Some links I clicked on which helped me discover more about the Medical Industry was  [Medical careers A-Z](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/explore-health-care-careers/careers-a-z/). This contained a vast amount of info of all the medical careers that I might be intrested in and the requirements for pursuing in them such as the amount of years that I need in order to be eligable for joining and the type of worktype that It will be taking in such as **Laboratories, Patient Care, Support and Administration**. 

Another Link That I looked at was the [Medical Encyclopedia](https://medlineplus.gov/encyclopedia.html) this was extremely useful in searching about the amount of details that is needed to know about the **human body, condition, and diseases** which is extremely important if you want to take part in the Medical Industry as it is needed to know whether to diagnose the patient or not.

## Medical 
I am currently on (Step 1) of learning about my passion of my career for now I chose the Medical Industry (Step 2) I am also researching of the possibilities of pursuing in the medical industry right now I found some websites that helped me know more about necessities of being in the Medical Industry at first I was a bit overwhelmed about the amount of info thrown towards me but I am slowly getting used to it. I think I might get throught (Step 2) rather quickly because I am a fast learner and get used to things fast.

## Skills
There are multiple skills that I learned while trying to make this blog is being how to **Trust reliable websites from google** I figured out that most credited websites either has a **.org** or a **.gov** these have the most confidential evidence since they are either made by the government or a organization which have the most factual evidence.

## Summary
